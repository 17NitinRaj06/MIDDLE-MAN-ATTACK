# MIDDLE-MAN-ATTACK
📝 Overview
This project demonstrates a controlled Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack using Ettercap on Kali Linux. It shows how an attacker can intercept and manipulate network traffic between two devices on a local network, highlighting the risks of unencrypted communication and weak network segmentation.

⚙️ Tools & Environment
Operating System: Kali Linux

Tool: Ettercap (Graphical or CLI mode)

Network Setup: LAN with two target devices

Optional: Wireshark for packet inspection

🚀 Steps to Reproduce
Launch Ettercap and select unified sniffing mode.

Scan for hosts and identify target IPs.

Start ARP poisoning between two devices.

Monitor or modify traffic (e.g., credentials, URLs, form data).

Optionally use filters to inject or block content.
